# CalculatorApp
This is a repo to track the work done for my Calculator App project

This is my first portfolio project. This is mostly code from the Bro Code tutorial below
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfhmTyRTCSQ

The functionality is fairly straightforward - It's a calculator that uses the Swing library to crate the
GUI for the calculator itself

One thing that I have decided to do that's different from the tutorial (which I thought would be more
efficient, turns out it was more code to write) was to encapsulate the action listener code to a different
class - Calculator Events. While this works as per the video, it's quite primitive and has lots of 
potential for improvements in the future. However for this first push to the GitHub repo I said i'd just
get this done and then separate out the improvement work for the future
